# Introduction
This workshop will show you how to Issue and Verify a SD-JWT Credential and Presentation using connectionless flows, meaning, you won't need to establish a didcomm connection between the Issuer, Holder and Verifier.

### **What Can I expect from this workshop?**

You will learn everything that is needed to receive an Issued SD-JWT credential from the Cloud Agent and then use this credential to respond to a Presentation Submission request.

### Setup & Instructions
1. Clone and cd into the Workshop directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-identus/identus
cd workshops/RareEvo-2025

2. Configure the environment variables

If you want to publish dids onChain in mainnet using any Cardano wallet, you will need 2 specific environment variables:

Optional
* NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKFROST_KEY, create your Blockfrost project [here](https://blockfrost.io/)
* NEXT_PUBLIC_RESOLVER_URL

NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIATOR_DID is also optional and configured to use the local [Identus mediator](https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-mediator)

So, if you want to publish dids on-chain on this workshop, you will need to configure NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKFROST_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_RESOLVER_URL. 

Create .env file inside the workshop directory and configure the env variables.

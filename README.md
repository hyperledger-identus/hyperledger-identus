# Hyperledger Identus

Hyperledger Identus is a comprehensive toolset for building decentralized identity solutions. It operates as a layer‑2 blockchain solution that uses a distributed ledger as a verifiable data registry (VDR). With Identus you can create and manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs), issue and revoke verifiable credentials and build systems based on the principles of self‑sovereign identity (SSI).

The documentation portal at [hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/) provides detailed guides and explanations. It covers identity concepts, how the Identus components work together and a Quick Start Guide for trying the software.

## Repository layout

This repository aggregates assets and information used across the Identus project:

- **identus-docker** – Docker Compose configuration for running the Cloud Agent, Mediator and their dependencies. See [dockerize-identus.md](identus-docker/dockerize-identus.md).
- **resources** – Logos and documents such as the Identus Technical Charter.
- **workshops** – Example applications demonstrating how to build with the Identus SDKs.
